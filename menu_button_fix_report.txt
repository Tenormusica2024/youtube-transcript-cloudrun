=== AI FM - Menu Button Visibility Fix Report ===
Date: Sat Aug 24 22:53:45     2025
Deployment: podcast-app-00016-6rb

🚨 ISSUE IDENTIFIED AND FIXED:

❌ Problem:
- Menu buttons (⋯) not appearing for logged-in users
- Episode cards rendered before authentication state was established
- currentUser variable available but episodes already rendered without menu buttons

✅ Root Cause:
- updateAuthUI() function was not re-rendering episodes after login/logout
- Menu button visibility depends on currentUser state at render time
- Initial episode load happened before Firebase auth state was determined

🔧 FIXES IMPLEMENTED:

1. Enhanced updateAuthUI() Function:
   - Added loadEpisodes() call after login state change
   - Episodes now re-render when user logs in/out
   - Menu buttons appear/disappear based on auth state

2. Improved Menu Button CSS:
   - Increased border opacity (0.15 → 0.25)
   - Changed color from muted to text (better visibility)
   - Increased base opacity (0.8 → 0.9)
   - Added subtle box-shadow for better definition

📋 TECHNICAL CHANGES:

JavaScript (templates/index.html):
```javascript
// In updateAuthUI() function - AFTER login:
// Re-render episodes to show menu buttons
loadEpisodes();

// In updateAuthUI() function - AFTER logout:
// Re-render episodes to hide menu buttons  
loadEpisodes();
```

CSS (static/css/style.css):
```css
.menu-button {
    border: 1px solid rgba(159, 247, 234, 0.25); /* was 0.15 */
    color: var(--text); /* was var(--muted) */
    opacity: 0.9; /* was 0.8 */
    box-shadow: 0 2px 8px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1); /* added */
}
```

🎯 EXPECTED BEHAVIOR NOW:
1. User visits page → No menu buttons (not logged in)
2. User logs in → Episodes re-render with menu buttons visible
3. User logs out → Episodes re-render with menu buttons hidden
4. Menu buttons are more visible with improved contrast
