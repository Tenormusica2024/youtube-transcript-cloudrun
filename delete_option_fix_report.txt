=== AI FM - Delete Option Visibility Fix Report ===
Date: Sat Aug 24 23:04:05     2025
Deployment: podcast-app-00018-rrd

üö® ISSUE IDENTIFIED AND FIXED:

‚ùå Problem:
- Delete options only shown to track owners (uploaders)
- Regular logged-in users couldn't see delete options
- Non-logged-in users shouldn't see delete options

‚úÖ Root Cause:
- Menu logic incorrectly restricted delete options to track owners only
- Should show delete options to ALL logged-in users
- Different delete actions needed for owners vs. non-owners

üîß FIXES IMPLEMENTED:

1. Menu Logic Correction:
   - BEFORE: Delete option only for `episode.uploaderUid === currentUser.uid`
   - AFTER: Delete option for ALL logged-in users (`currentUser` exists)

2. Smart Delete Action Selection:
   - Track Owner: "DELETE TRACK" ‚Üí `confirmDeleteTrack()`
   - Other Users: "REMOVE FROM LIBRARY" ‚Üí `removeFromLibrary()`

üìã TECHNICAL CHANGES:

HTML Menu Structure (Before):
```html
${episode.uploaderUid === currentUser.uid ? 
    `<button>DELETE TRACK</button>` : ''
}
```

HTML Menu Structure (After):
```html
<button onclick="${episode.uploaderUid === currentUser.uid ? 
    `confirmDeleteTrack(...)` : `removeFromLibrary(...)`
}">
    ${episode.uploaderUid === currentUser.uid ? 
        'DELETE TRACK' : 'REMOVE FROM LIBRARY'
    }
</button>
```

üéØ CURRENT BEHAVIOR:

1. **Non-logged-in users**:
   - No menu button visible ‚úÖ
   - No delete options ‚úÖ

2. **Logged-in users (Track Owner)**:
   - Menu button visible ‚úÖ
   - "ADD TO PLAYLIST" option ‚úÖ
   - "DELETE TRACK" option ‚úÖ
   - Permanent deletion from system

3. **Logged-in users (Not Owner)**:
   - Menu button visible ‚úÖ
   - "ADD TO PLAYLIST" option ‚úÖ
   - "REMOVE FROM LIBRARY" option ‚úÖ
   - Personal library management
